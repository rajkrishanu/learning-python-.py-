# Here's a Python program that checks whether a number is a Krishnamurthy number or not:
import math
def is_krishnamurthy_number(n):
  digits = str(n)
  factorial_sum = sum(math.factorial(int(digit)) for digit in digits)
  return factorial_sum == n

test_number = [145, 40585, 123]
for number in test_numbers:
  if is_krishnamurthy_number(number):
    print(f"{number} is a Krishnamurthy number.")
  else:
    print(f"{number} is not a Krishnamurthy number.")

"""
Additional Notes:
The factorial calculation is done using 'math.factorial', which is optimized for performance compared to a manually implemented factorial function.
